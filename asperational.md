# MMORPG idea

- worlds render using shared power of users computers
- starts as very simply generated graphics, as users and number of hits increases so does visual fidelity via ML
- classic d&d crawler / tolkien lore rules apply, persistent lore so long as events are remembered...
- as explorers spread out the map is built and stored in ever increasing detail per cycle
  - users' computers figures out if it should spend resources rendering visual fidelity for user vs increasing details and depth to known environment based on location, resource availability, and performance balance
- things get fuzzier when not visited for a while
  - some kind of burn rate
  - number of recent visits
  - historical signifigance/detail of lore reference
- procedurally generated, shit gets rolled off based on visitation rate and lore detail
- some kind of historical marker system to remember critical criteria, probably seed data for ML algo that generates the world using shared resources
  - things can get forgotten and procedurally revisited later for different outcomes
  - rewriting history as things get forgotten is part of the reality of the world
  - will have to figure out logic that drives this but i like the concept

## Basic rules

- inventory system based on strength
- strength relative to localized forces of the realm
- starting classes based on tolkienian and d&d lore

### per server variance

servers will have initial seed rules for certian criteria

- realms predefinedish based on initial seed, can evolve per server
- ability to act based on d&d rules on initial seed, can evolve per server

# Pie in the sky

- render a story, in real time, based on quests and shit completed or failed by players
- would be edited as things are rendered/forgotten/rerendered based on leftover fuzzy details
- could be wild, is way the fuck beyond me.
